Here are ten common database design patterns that are widely used to structure and optimize database systems:

One-to-Many (Parent-Child) Pattern

Often used to represent hierarchical relationships. For example, a "Customers" table with a one-to-many relationship with an "Orders" table. Each customer can have multiple orders.
Many-to-Many Pattern

Used when multiple records in one table relate to multiple records in another, typically implemented with a junction table. For example, "Students" and "Courses" with a "StudentCourses" table linking them.
Star Schema Pattern

Common in data warehousing, with a central fact table linked to multiple dimension tables. It’s efficient for analytical queries. For instance, a "Sales" fact table linked to "Product," "Customer," and "Time" dimension tables.
Snowflake Schema Pattern

An extension of the Star Schema where dimension tables are further normalized into multiple related tables. This pattern reduces redundancy and is ideal for complex data warehouses.
Entity-Attribute-Value (EAV) Pattern

Stores data in a flexible way by allowing dynamic attributes. Useful for scenarios where each record has a variable number of attributes, such as medical records where each patient may have different sets of data.
Temporal Pattern

Used to track historical data by including effective dates or timestamps for changes. This is ideal for applications needing data versioning, such as tracking a product’s price changes over time.
Single Table Inheritance Pattern

Stores different types of entities in a single table with columns for shared and unique attributes. Often used in object-relational mapping, for example, storing "Employees" and "Managers" in one table with a "type" column.
Table Partitioning Pattern

Divides a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces based on criteria such as range, list, or hash. Useful in very large databases to improve query performance and manageability.
Soft Delete Pattern

Instead of deleting records, this pattern uses a status flag (e.g., "is_deleted") to mark them as inactive. This allows for recovery and helps maintain data integrity in historical analysis.
Audit Logging Pattern

Involves creating a separate audit table or including audit fields in the main table to track changes (e.g., timestamps, user IDs). This is essential for applications that require a record of who made changes to data and when.
Each of these patterns serves specific needs in database design, depending on the data structure, relationships, and the performance or scalability requirements of the application.

Here are additional database design patterns commonly used to address specific requirements and improve database performance and scalability:

Polymorphic Association Pattern
Allows a model to belong to multiple other models using a single association, typically by including a type and ID field. For example, a "Comments" table that can be associated with either "Posts" or "Photos" through fields like commentable_id and commentable_type.
Index Table Pattern
Aims to speed up read performance by creating a secondary table containing indexed fields from the main table. This is especially useful for queries requiring frequent access to specific columns without needing to load the entire row.
Sharding Pattern
Divides a large database into smaller, faster, and more manageable parts (shards), distributed across multiple servers. Sharding is popular in distributed databases and is suitable for applications with high transaction volumes, like social media platforms.
Read-Replica Pattern
Involves creating a read-only copy of a database to handle read-heavy traffic, thus reducing the load on the primary database. It’s often used in applications that require high read availability, such as e-commerce websites.
Event Sourcing Pattern
Stores all changes to application state as a sequence of events, rather than storing only the current state. Useful in systems where a complete history of changes is needed, such as financial applications that track transactions.
Materialized View Pattern
Creates and maintains a precomputed, persistent view that stores query results, which is then periodically updated. This pattern is ideal for complex queries on large datasets, as it speeds up query performance by avoiding repetitive computation.
Aggregate Pattern
Combines multiple entities that are always updated together into a single database transaction to ensure data integrity. This is particularly helpful for domain-driven design and is common in complex applications where changes in one entity impact others.
Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Pattern
Involves writing updates to a log before applying them to the database, ensuring data integrity in case of a crash. This is often used in relational databases to maintain atomicity and durability in transactions.
CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) Pattern
Separates read and write operations by using different data models for updating data and for reading it. This pattern is ideal for applications where reads and writes have different performance or consistency requirements.
Multi-Tenancy Pattern
Enables a single database instance to support multiple tenants (customers) by either separating data at the schema level (schema-per-tenant) or within tables (row-per-tenant). This pattern is widely used in SaaS applications.
Hierarchical Data Pattern
Handles hierarchical or tree-like data structures, such as categories or organizational charts. Common techniques include adjacency lists, nested sets, and path enumeration for representing parent-child relationships within the database.
Denormalization Pattern
Introduces redundancy into a database schema to optimize read performance, often used in NoSQL or read-heavy environments where speed is prioritized over strict normalization.
Snapshot Pattern
Stores periodic snapshots of data state to avoid reconstructing it from an event log. This is helpful for performance optimization in systems using event sourcing, where frequently querying the full history can be costly.
Data Vault Pattern
Provides a flexible and scalable way to model data warehouses by separating raw data (hubs) from relationships (links) and descriptive data (satellites). It’s useful in handling historical data and making changes with minimal disruption.
SCD (Slowly Changing Dimensions) Pattern
Used to manage changes in dimension data over time in data warehousing. Common types include maintaining both old and new values for historical analysis, as in customer information that changes over time.
Fact Constellation Schema Pattern
An extension of the star schema, where multiple fact tables share dimension tables, forming a constellation. This pattern is useful for complex analytical systems, such as reporting systems that combine multiple sources of information.
Foreign Key Constraining Pattern
Utilizes foreign key constraints in relational databases to enforce referential integrity between tables. This ensures that all references between tables are valid and prevents orphaned records.
Dimensional Modeling Pattern
Structures data around facts and dimensions to simplify complex queries, making it ideal for analytics and business intelligence systems.
Shared Database Pattern
Multiple applications share the same database while maintaining separate schemas or tables. This is commonly used in microservices architectures to prevent data duplication and ensure consistency.
Data Federation Pattern
Combines data from multiple sources into a unified view without moving it to a central storage location. This is useful in scenarios where integrating data without replication is required, such as distributed systems.
